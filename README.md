## Configuration

The application uses environment-specific YAML files for configuration:

- `local-properties.yaml`: Local development environment
- `dev-properties.yaml`: Development environment

## Testing the API

Once the application is running, you can test the API endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/hello
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "message": "hello world"
}
```
